# Hybrid Frameworks Tutorial

Hi, visitors. How do you feel today?

Here's a book for you to get started with hybrid solutions like [ionic](http://ionicframework.com), [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native), [crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/) and so on. This is a project to guide you through the whole process of making an app, who keeps asking *How do you feel today*.

Through the tutorial, we are going to build a simple app to record your everyday mood. By the end of the tutorial, we will have an app with two pages, one for recording today's mood, the other for calendar.

I hope to learn these frameworks better through practice, and deepen impression towards them through writing this book. You're welcomed to contribute code or help edit this book if you wish. Leave comment about your thoughts!

I'm writing a book at [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ovilia/hybrid-framework-tutorial/details) along with updating this project.
